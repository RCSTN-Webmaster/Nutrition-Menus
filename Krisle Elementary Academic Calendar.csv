TCAP testing for 3rd-5th Grade,2025-04-15 08:00 AM,2025-05-01 08:30 AM,,"Encourage your child to:
     

  1.  Get a good night's rest and eat a normal breakfast before testing.
  2.  Arrive at school on time, stay relaxed and think positively.
  3.  Read and pay careful attention to all directions.
  4.  Read every possible answer - the best one could be last.
  5.  Decide exactly what the question is asking; one response is clearly best.
  6.  Read and respond to items one at a time rather than thinking about the whole test.
  7.  Don't expect to find a pattern in the positions of the correct answers.
  8.  Don't spend too much time on any one question.
  9.  Don't make uneducated guesses. Try to get the correct answer by reasoning and eliminating wrong answers.
  10. Skip difficult questions until all other questions have been answered. On scrap paper, keep a record of the unanswered items to return to, if time permits.
  11. After completing the test, use any remaining time to check your answers.
